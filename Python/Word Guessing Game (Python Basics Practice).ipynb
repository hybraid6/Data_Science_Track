    "1. **Task Description**:\n",
    "Create a game that allows a player to guess a word chosen randomly from a predefined list of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instructions**:\n",
    "     - **Step 1**: Import the `random` module.\n",
    "     - **Step 2**: Create a list of words called `words_list` containing several words.\n",
    "     - **Step 3**: Print a welcome message to the player, informing them about the game and displaying the list of words they can guess from.\n",
    "     - **Step 4**: Use the `random.choice()` function to select a random word from the `words_list` and assign it to the variable `word_to_guess`.\n",
    "     - **Step 5**: Create a boolean variable called `guessed_correctly` and set it to `False`. This variable will track whether the player has guessed the word correctly.\n",
    "     - **Step 6**: Start a `while` loop that continues until `guessed_correctly` is `True`.\n",
    "     - **Step 7**: Inside the loop, prompt the player to enter their guess using the `input()` function. Strip any leading or trailing whitespace from the input and convert it to lowercase.\n",
    "     - **Step 8**: Check if the guess matches the `word_to_guess`. If it does, print a congratulatory message informing the player that they have guessed the word correctly and set `guessed_correctly` to `True` to end the loop.\n",
    "     - **Step 9**: If the guess is incorrect, inform the player that their guess is incorrect and prompt them to guess again.\n",
    "     - **Step 10**: Continue looping until the player guesses the word correctly."

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the random module (a library)**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import random\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This allows us to use functions from the `random` module, such as selecting a random word.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define a list of words**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   words_list = [\"python\", \"java\", \"kotlin\", \"javascript\", \"ruby\", \"swift\"]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This list contains the words that the player will be guessing from.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Print the welcome message**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   print(\"Welcome to the Word Guessing Game!\")\n",
    "   print(\"I'm thinking of a word from the following list:\")\n",
    "   print(words_list)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   These lines introduce the game to the player and show the list of possible words to be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Select a random word from the list**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   word_to_guess = random.choice(words_list)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line selects a random word from the list for the player to guess and assigns the selection to 'word_to_guess'.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Initialize the guessed_correctly variable**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   guessed_correctly = False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This variable tracks whether the player has guessed the word correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use a while loop to keep asking for guesses until the correct word is guessed**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   '''\n",
    "   This guessed_correctly part may turn your head a little (It turned mine). \n",
    "   A while loop needs a condition to be True to continue running; it stops when the condition becomes False\n",
    "   guessed_correctly is currently False but the 'not' in the following line turns it to True.\n",
    "   '''\n",
    "   while not guessed_correctly:\n",
    "       # Prompt the player to enter their guess\n",
    "       guess = input(\"Enter your guess: \").strip().lower() \n",
    "       # The 'input' function creates a box which the recipient is expected to type in.\n",
    "       # 'strip removes extra spaces and 'lower' changes the input to small letters\n",
    "       # Check if the guess is correct\n",
    "       if guess == word_to_guess:\n",
    "           print(\"Congratulations! You guessed the word correctly!\")\n",
    "           guessed_correctly = True  # End the loop\n",
    "       else:\n",
    "           print(\"Your guess is incorrect. Guess again.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `while` loop continues until `guessed_correctly` is set to `True`.\n",
    "   - The `input` function prompts the player for their guess.\n",
    "   - The `strip().lower()` methods are used to remove any leading/trailing spaces and convert the guess to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.\n",
    "   - The `if` statement checks if the guess matches the selected word.\n",
    "   - If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is printed and `guessed_correctly` is set to `True`, ending the loop.\n",
    "   - If the guess is incorrect, the player is prompted to guess again.\n",
